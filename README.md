# MLWithR
Machine learning experiments run in R

This repo presents a number of machine learning experiments run in R. 

The purpose of this analysis is to apply ML techniques in R to concrete and real-life cases.

This repo does not replicate the work done by other tutorials, but rather presents simple R scripts for personal practice.
