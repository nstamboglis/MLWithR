**Practicing Machine Learning with R**

This project contains machine learning experiments solved in R.

The purpose of this project is to showcase practical solutions to real-world machine learning problems using the R software.

The exercises and techniques are solved in dedicated r scripts.

**List of my scripts**

Below are the scripts I've played with. All original sources are listed within the scripts.

* **IrisClassification.R** -> simple iris classification problem;
* **FeatureSelectionCaret.R** -> exploration of feature selection (and more) using Caret.
